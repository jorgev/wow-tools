								<p>This site can be used to parse World of Warcraft combat log files. Combat data is logged any time you enable combat logging by using the /combatlog option in-game. The data is written to a file named WoWCombatLog.txt in the Logs folder of your installation directory. Combat logging is not enabled by default, you must enable it using the option mentioned. Furthermore, the option to log is not persisted, so you must re-enable anytime you log out or switch characters and come back into the game.</p>

							<div class="post_body">
								<p>This parser works by allowing you to upload your combat log file. Keep in mind that combat files can get very large, so you may want to break up individual encounters into smaller files. In almost every case, you'll want to trim you file to a specific encounter. Multiple attempts on a single encounter should also be broken up into separate files. There are several reasons for you to do this: 1) smaller files are parsed much more quickly, 2) the combat log does not include entering/leaving combat events, so the HPS/DPS stats will be a lot more accurate as they will not include idle time and 3) the stats data is fairly comprehensive so you'll want to keep the data to a manageable level. The best/easiest way to trim your log file for a specific encounter is to look for the very first and last entries keyed by the name of the encounter, deleting everything before the first and after the last events. For example, if you want to parse your Lady Deathwhisper encounter, search for the very first entry in the log file containing that name. To find the last entry, look for the line that says UNIT_DIED and also has Lady Deathwhisper in the same line. The easiest way to do this is with a regular expression, such as "UNIT_DIED.*Lady Deathwhisper". Then delete everything after that. A typical size for a 10-man encounter is about 2MB, and ~ 5MB for a 25-man encounter. Also, please note that I do not save the combat log files that are uploaded.</p>
