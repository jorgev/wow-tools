This repository contains tools that are used to analyze, parse or monitor World of Warcraft combat log files.  It includes awk scripts for quick analysis of specific data (e.g., how many HP a particular NPC has) and also contains complete parsers for a more in-depth analysis.  All of the scripts operate on the latest version of combat log files generated by the game client.

Please note that the scripts assume Unix-type line endings, you may need to convert your combat log file to use Unix-type line endings in order for the scripts to work properly.
