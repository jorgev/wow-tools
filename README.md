This repository contains tools that are used to analyze, parse or monitor World of Warcraft combat log files.  It includes Python scripts for quick analysis of specific data (e.g., how many HP a particular NPC has) and also contains complete parsers for a more in-depth analysis.  All of the scripts operate on the latest version of combat log files generated by the game client.
